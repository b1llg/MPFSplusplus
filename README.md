# MPFS++

MPFS++ is an attempt at creating a modular, easy to use, multyphyics finite element code.

## Project Objectives
MPFS++ uses a custom input format to assign property, assign material and define multiple domains for solid mechanics, heat transfer and fluid mechanics.

## Current Capabilities
Able to solve steady state solid mechanics problem for truss element (E1TR2)
